### BioNetFit
BioNetFit is a general-purpose fitting program for rule-based models written in the BioNetGen language. 

### Features
 * BioNetFit implements a genetic algorithm for optimization
 * BioNetFit can be used on a stand-alone computer or a Linux-based cluster
 * BioNetFit is compatible with the various simulation capabilities provided by BioNetGen (generate-first deterministic, stochastic and hybrid methods and network-free stochastic methods) can be used with BioNetFit. 
 * BioNetFit can perform a global fit, meaning that it can consider multiple datasets in the course of a fitting run. Preprocessing of data (for example, normalization of the average of the measurement values in each dataset) is advised when considering multiple datasets. 
 * BioNetFit can consider steady-state dose-response data and/or time-series data.
